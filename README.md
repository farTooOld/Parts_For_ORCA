A Collection Of Parts To Use In ORCA and other slicers to Build or Modify Parts...

ORCA-Slicer is used as basis for some rebranded Slicers and I've been using it exclusively for past 7-months and have built a small collection of Test Parts that I've been using for Guinea-pigging with some Users.

These parts can be used as Parts, Positive and Negative (Parts) for building and/or modifying Parts (primarily for User's not wanting to use CAD.

Parts include:
• Edge Radius
• Inner and Outer Corner Radius
• Edge Chamfer
• Cap/Cover (to put Radius'd edge on Cylinder's)
• Gear
• Shaft (for the Gear)
• Cylindrical Radius for mounting Boss's interface to the Gear
• Bolts
• Losmandy Slide Mount (used a Negative to Pocket the large Cube)
• M50x20 Threaded Cylinder
• Circular Ring (for the M50x20)
• Oval (primarily for Oblong Holes)

GIF shows the Inner-Radius part as a Non-Homogeneous sliced item (I improperly placed it to show that if Not doing it correctly, it will Slice in manner that may Not be Contiguously Infilled (so, I set it's height 1mm above the Cube to easiy identify it).

Note: A part built in ORCA can be Exported (and can be Assembled, Boolean-Meshed...etc).
